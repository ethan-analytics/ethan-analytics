## 🚀 Projects
Here are some of my recent projects that showcase a blend of technical and business thinking:

### ☁️ [AWS Machine Learning Pipeline for E-Commerce Delay Prediction](https://github.com/ethan-analytics/aws-ecommerce-pipeline)
Built a scalable AWS pipeline (S3, Glue, Athena, PySpark) processing 1.5M+ Olist e-commerce records into curated fact/dim tables. Engineered features (shipping times, reviews, lag variables) and trained XGBoost (recall ~99%). Delivered insights via Power BI dashboards (KPIs, confusion matrix, probability distributions).

### 🔬 [ML Customer Segmentation & Health Prediction](https://github.com/ethan-analytics/ml-customer-segmentation-health-prediction)
Clustered customers using K-Means, GMM, and HAC. Predicted liver disease with Random Forest (88.9% accuracy) using patient features. Includes PCA, cross-validation, and business recommendations.

### ✈️ [Flight Delay Modeling & Operational Optimization](https://github.com/ethan-analytics/flight-delay-prediction-analysis)
Analyzed 50,000+ flight records. Built logistic regression and Bayesian models to predict diversions. Identified optimal flying hours and quantified carrier-specific delay risk.

### 📈 [Retail Sales Analytics with Tableau](https://github.com/ethan-analytics/Retail-Data-Analytics-Dashboarding-with-Tableau-5-Visualizations-)
Created 5 Tableau dashboards analyzing customer, product, region, profit, and sales data. Delivered actionable insights on top SKUs, customer behavior, and margin improvement.
